  * `controllers` â€“ for PHP scripts that handle form logic and backend processing.
  * `models` â€“ for database operations and business logic.
  * `views` â€“ for user interfaces (admin, customer, and authentication views).
  * `uploads` â€“ to store uploaded images (e.g., product photos).
  * `api` â€“ for lightweight PHP scripts to respond to AJAX or mobile APIs.

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 3: Build the Admin Authentication System**

- Create a login form in `views/auth/login.php`.

- Create an admin dashboard in `views/admin/dashboard.php`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 4: Set Up Product Management**

- Store uploaded product images in `uploads/product-images`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 5: Build the Customer-Facing Pages**

- Homepage and product listings go in `views/customer/shop.php`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 6: Create the Cart and Checkout System**

- Let customers add products to a cart using session or JavaScript.

- Use `sms/send-sms.php` to send SMS updates (if using an SMS API like Africaâ€™s Talking or Twilio).

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 9: Organize Helper and Reusable Code**

- Use `helpers/functions.php` for custom functions (e.g., formatCurrency).
- Use `includes/header.php`, `footer.php`, etc., to avoid repeating layout code across pages.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 10: Test and Secure the System**

- Add validation and error handling.
